Problem:
	Write a program that plays the game of HANGMAN(guessing a
	mystery word).  Read a word to be guessed from a file into
	successive elements of the array WORD. The player must
	guess the letters belonging to WORD. A single guessing
	session should be terminated when either all letters have
	been guessed correctly (player wins) or a specified number
	of incorrect guesses have been made (computer wins). A run
	must consist of at least two sessions: one player wins and
	one computer wins. The player decides whether or not to
	start a new session.
